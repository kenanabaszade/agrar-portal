echo "=== Summary of Approaches ==="

echo "üîÑ SINGLE ENDPOINT APPROACH:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Pros: Atomic operations, simpler frontend, better UX"

echo "   üìç Use Case: Small files, simple uploads, quick training creation"

echo "üîÑ SEPARATE ENDPOINT APPROACH:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Pros: Better performance, progressive upload, more flexible"
echo "   ‚ùå Cons: More complex, partial states, multiple requests"
echo "   üìç Use Case: Large files, many files, advanced file management"

echo "üîÑ HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED):"
echo "   ‚úÖ Best of both worlds"
echo "   üìç Use single endpoint for simple cases"

echo "üìù Training CRUD (with optional files):"

echo "üéØ Use SINGLE ENDPOINT when:"
echo "   - Creating training with small files (< 10MB total)"
echo "   - Simple training creation workflow"
echo "   - Want atomic operations"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Use SEPARATE ENDPOINTS when:"
echo "   - Adding files to existing training"
echo "   - Large file uploads (> 10MB)"
echo "   - Progressive file upload"
echo "   - Advanced file management"
echo "   - Want better error handling for file uploads"
